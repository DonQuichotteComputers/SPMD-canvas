# SPMD-canvas
A Parallella SPMD canvas with configurable event timers (SPMD = Single Program Multiple Data)

Choose the more elaborate *b.zip file for ANY event timer activated and displayed, helping for tiny C code benchmarks.

The *c.zip file is uptodate and adds support for assembly routines. Hopefully useful for low-level benchmarks.
